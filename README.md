# flood

Turn-based procedurally generated cave explorer game

## Concept

- "Reverse" dungeon crawler: The main objective is to escape the flooding dungeon.
- I want to port the result to android and make it available on play store and maybe F-droid.

## Todos and Ideas

### High-priority

- [ ] Add player.
- [ ] Add NPCs.
- [ ] Meaningful dungeon generation.

### Low-priority

- [ ] Add **flow** from high to low water levels. This doesn't affect water propagation but it can drag entities.

### To consider

- Ways to interact with NPCs other than fighting.
